    <h3>I hope you enjoyed my game.
        Here are the answers to the questions:
        <ol>
            <li>I do not own a car.  Haven't owned one in 5 years.  I love bikes though!  I've ridden all over the country and I'm currently working as a bicycle courier here in Seattle.</li>
            <li>Javascript isn't technically my first experience with programming, but it's been a very long time.  When I was a kid, my dad taught me to program in BASIC on our Commodore 64.  Later on I did some scripting (in a language I believe was loosely based on perl) and some basic HTML design.  (Back when all HTML design was basic.)</li>
            <li>I have never jumped out of an airplane, but I did get an Abrams tank airborne once.</li>
            <li>I did swim with dolphins, but not on purpose.  My kayak sprung a leak and capsized 5 miles out in the Gulf of Mexico and they showed up around sunset while I was floating back to shore.  Sometimes there is still beauty in the midst of disaster.</li>
            <li>Not even a little bit.</li>
        </ol>
    </h3>
    <p>I had a lot of fun making this.  There were a few roadblocks I encountered along the way, but I began spending way too much time on the wrong parts of the project, so I noted them and moved on to the tasks at hand.  </p>
