    <h3>I hope you enjoyed my game.</h3>
    <p>I had a lot of fun making this.  There were a few roadblocks I encountered along the way, but I began spending way too much time on the wrong parts of the project, so I noted them and moved on to the tasks at hand.  </p>
    <h2>Challenges I Encountered:
        <ul>
            <li>I couldn't figure out how to make the page load before calling the javascript.</li>
            <li>I couldn't figure out how to call the javascript on command.</li>
            <li>I couldn't figure out how to draw different pages before and after running the javascript.</li>
            <li>I spent more time thinking of 5 questions to ask about myself than I did working on the foundation of the code.  I'm not bragging about my coding skills; I'm just that shy.</li>
            <li>When I link to an external web address from a file i loaded locally, it just reloads the page.  I tried pushing it to git and loading it there, but it just displays the code of index.html as text.</li>
        </ul>
        </h2>
        <p1>I had a few ideas I would have liked to incorporate into my web page, and found a few solutions that would have worked for some of them, but they generally involved even more javascript functions I haven't learned yet, and it became a rabbit hole of looking up material unnecessary for the assignment that will likely be covered soon in class anyway.</p>
            <p1>Initially, I thought it would be cool to have a page introducing the game, and end with a different page explaining some of the answers, and displaying the users score.</p>
            <p2>I also spent a shameful amount of time with the css because it's the one I know the least about of the three, and I can't remember much about it from the prework.  Hopefully I have gotten up early, worked on it some more, and edited this out.  If not, I apologize for how 1992 it looks, but function won out over form.</p>
