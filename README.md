# about_me
This is a simple script asking 5 yes or no questions about me, keeping track of the user's score.

I devoted most of the web page to creating a sort of open dialogue/log about my process of working through the lab and the challenges that arose, particularly the ones that I didn't solve, as a reference for later.  

This is stylistically a nightmare.  I focused more on getting the structure in place for the HTML and CSS pages, but this is by far my weakest area.  I understand the syntax, but I'm unfamiliar with most of the commands.  I don't really know which ones to look up more information on because, in this case, I don't really have any idea what I want the web page to look like or what is even possible to do with it.
